# Step 4 — Categorise the finding

## Step 4 — Categorise the finding

For each failing finding, decide which of the three buckets it falls into:

### Real finding — fix the code

The check is correctly flagging a problem. Examples:
- Secrets check finds an actual leaked API key → revoke immediately, scrub history (`git filter-repo` or BFG), then fix the leak source.
- SAST flags a SQL injection in a query builder → rewrite to use parameterised queries.
- Accessibility flags a missing `alt` on a real image → add the alt text.
- Broken-links check flags an internal link that 404s → fix or remove the link.

There's no escape hatch here. Fix the code.

### False positive — suppress narrowly with `# why`

The check's heuristic is misfiring on this codebase. Use the check's documented suppression mechanism — never disable globally — and always carry a `# why` comment so the next reader knows why the exception is justified.

| Check | Suppression file / mechanism | Granularity |
|---|---|---|
| Secrets (gitleaks) | `.gitleaks.toml` `[allowlist]` block | Path or regex |
| SAST (Semgrep) | `# nosemgrep: <rule-id>` inline, or `.semgrepignore` for path-scoped | Inline or path |
| DAST (OWASP ZAP) — CSP findings | `docs/security/CSP_EXCEPTIONS.md` `## Exceptions` → `### /path` heading (glob patterns supported: `/*`, `/blog/*`) | Per-path |
| DAST — other rule false positives | `.zap/rules.tsv` → `<plugin-id>\tIGNORE\t# why` | Per-rule, site-wide |
| Accessibility (axe-core) | `disabledRules` in the spec, or scope the spec to exclude the offending selector | Per-rule or per-element |
| Vulnerability (Trivy) | `.trivyignore` with the CVE ID + a `# why` line | Per-CVE |
| Complexity (lizard) | Refactor the function, or raise `hygiene.complexity.max_ccn` in `.slopstopper.yml` (default 15) with a `# why` note | Per-repo (the ceiling is global) |

Each suppression is a documented gate exception, not a way to quiet findings that should be fixed. The PR that adds it is the place reviewers catch it.

### Threshold too tight — tune in `.slopstopper.yml`

The check is correct but the default threshold doesn't fit this repo. **First check `.slopstopper.yml`** — many checks read their thresholds from there, falling back to a hardcoded default when unset. The example file ([`.slopstopper.yml.example`](https://github.com/hungovercoders/slopstopper/blob/main/.slopstopper.yml.example)) is the canonical schema reference.

Config-driven knobs (no file edit needed beyond `.slopstopper.yml`):

| Check | Keys | Defaults |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hygiene:docs-size` | `hygiene.docs_size.max_total_size_kb` / `.max_file_size_kb` / `.max_files` | 150 / 20 / 25 |
| `hygiene:entry-files` | `hygiene.entry_files.max_words` / `.require_map_pointer` / `.map_path` | 1500 / true / `docs/index.md` |
| `hygiene:docs-accuracy` | `hygiene.docs_accuracy.extra_paths` | `[]` — only `docs/` + the root entry files are scanned |
| `hygiene:docs-structure` | `hygiene.docs_structure.require_indexed_docs` | `true` — every doc linked from a README above it |
| `reliability:smoke` | `pages.smoke`, `smoke.og_image_path` | `/`, `/og-image.png` |
| `reliability:{accessibility,seo,broken_links}` | `pages.<check>`, `reliability.coverage.<event>` | `/`, hand-list mode |
| `hygiene:csp-exceptions` | `headers.source`, `headers.format` | unset (graceful skip) |

Tunings that are NOT yet config-driven (require code/file edits):

- `docs/hygiene/README.md` complexity config — lizard cyclomatic complexity caps.
- `.ss/lighthouserc.json` (or the bundled `cli/slopstopper/data/lighthouserc.json`) — Core Web Vitals thresholds. Edit the `.ss/` copy if you want adopter-side persistence; the CLI prefers it over the package-data fallback.

Tuning is a real decision — when you raise a threshold, leave a `# why` comment in `.slopstopper.yml` so the next maintainer doesn't roll it back. Don't tune to silence noise; tune to match a deliberate design decision.
