# SAST — Static Application Security Testing

This template includes automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using **Semgrep** to detect security bugs and anti-patterns in your own source code. This guide explains how to customise and use this feature.

## Quick Start

### Run Analysis Locally
```bash
task sast
```

### What You Get Automatically
- ✅ PR comments with SAST findings report
- ✅ Merge blocking if any ERROR-severity findings exist
- ✅ GitHub issues on main branch for error-severity problems

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow not triggering? | Check workflow is at `.github/workflows/ss-security-sast-check.yml` |
| Want stricter/looser rules? | Use a custom Semgrep config file (see below) |
| Don't want SAST checks? | Delete `.github/workflows/ss-security-sast-check.yml` |

### Severity Reference

| Severity | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ERROR | 🔴 Blocking | Must be fixed before merge |
| WARNING | ⚠️ Non-blocking | Review recommended |
| INFO | ℹ️ Informational | Awareness only |

---

## Overview

What SAST checks: **your own source code** for security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns using pattern matching (e.g. dangerous function calls, injection risks, hardcoded secrets).

The SAST workflow:
- ✅ Runs automatically on every PR to `main` and push to `main`
- ✅ Analyses code using Semgrep's auto-configured rule set
- ✅ Posts findings as PR comments
- ✅ Creates GitHub issues when error-severity findings land on `main`
- ✅ Fails PRs with error-severity findings

## Files Involved

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ss-security-sast-check.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `Taskfile.yml` (`sast*` tasks) | Local task runner config |
| `.ss/scripts/generate-sast-md.py` | Report generator |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `.ss/reports/sast/` |

## Key Configuration Points

### Custom Rule Set

By default, Semgrep runs with `--config=auto`. To use a specific ruleset, update the `sast:analyze` task in `Taskfile.yml`:

```yaml
semgrep \
  --config=p/owasp-top-ten \   # ← replace --config=auto
  --json \
  ...
```

### Disable SAST Checking

```bash
# Option A: delete the workflow
rm .github/workflows/ss-security-sast-check.yml

# Option B: disable in GitHub UI → Actions → SAST Analysis → Disable workflow
```

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install Task (one-time)
curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Run SAST
task sast
```

Reports are saved to `.ss/reports/sast/`.

# DAST — Dynamic Application Security Testing

This template includes automated Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using **OWASP ZAP** to detect runtime security issues by scanning your running site. This guide explains how to customise and use this feature.

## Quick Start

### Run Analysis Locally
```bash
# Start the site first
task start &
# Run DAST scan against it
task dast -- http://localhost:8080
```

### What You Get Automatically
- ✅ PR comments with DAST findings report
- ✅ Merge blocking if any High or Medium alerts exist
- ✅ GitHub issues on main branch for blocking alerts

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow not triggering? | Check workflow is at `.github/workflows/ss-security-dast-check.yml` |
| ZAP not available? | The workflow uses Docker to run ZAP — no installation needed in CI |
| Don't want DAST checks? | Delete `.github/workflows/ss-security-dast-check.yml` |

### Risk Level Reference

| Risk Level | riskcode | Status | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| High | 3 | 🔴 Blocking | Must be fixed before merge |
| Medium | 2 | 🟡 Blocking | Must be fixed before merge |
| Low | 1 | 🔵 Non-blocking | Review when time allows |
| Informational | 0 | ℹ️ Non-blocking | Awareness only |

---

## Overview

What DAST checks: **your running application** for HTTP-level security vulnerabilities — missing security headers, injection vectors, exposed sensitive endpoints, and other issues that only appear at runtime.

The DAST workflow:
- ✅ Starts a local http-server for the static site
- ✅ Runs OWASP ZAP baseline scan against it
- ✅ Posts findings as PR comments
- ✅ Creates GitHub issues when High/Medium alerts land on `main`
- ✅ Fails PRs with High or Medium alerts

## Files Involved

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ss-security-dast-check.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `Taskfile.yml` (`dast*` tasks) | Local task runner config |
| `.ss/scripts/generate-dast-md.py` | Report generator |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `.ss/reports/dast/` |

## Key Configuration Points

### Change the Target URL

In `Taskfile.yml`, the `dast` task accepts the target URL as an argument:

```bash
task dast -- http://your-site-url
```

In `ss-security-dast-check.yml`, the CI workflow starts a local server and passes `http://localhost:8080`. To scan a deployed preview instead, update that step with your preview URL.

### Change the Blocking Threshold

To block only on High (not Medium), edit `ss-security-dast-check.yml`:

```python
# Change this line:
if int(alert.get('riskcode', 0)) >= 2:
# To:
if int(alert.get('riskcode', 0)) >= 3:
```

### Disable DAST Checking

```bash
# Option A: delete the workflow
rm .github/workflows/ss-security-dast-check.yml

# Option B: disable in GitHub UI → Actions → DAST Analysis → Disable workflow
```

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install Task (one-time)
curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Start the site
task start &

# Run DAST scan (requires Docker)
task dast -- http://localhost:8080
```

Reports are saved to `.ss/reports/dast/`.

# Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

This template includes automated dependency vulnerability scanning using **Trivy** to detect known CVEs in your project's dependencies. This guide explains how to customise and use this feature.

## Quick Start

### Run Analysis Locally
```bash
task dependencies
```

### What You Get Automatically
- ✅ PR comments with vulnerability report
- ✅ Merge blocking if any CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities exist
- ✅ GitHub issues on main branch for blocking vulnerabilities

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow not triggering? | Check workflow is at `.github/workflows/ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml` |
| Want to change blocking threshold? | Edit severity check in `ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml` |
| Don't want vulnerability scans? | Delete `.github/workflows/ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml` |

### Severity Reference

| Severity | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| CRITICAL | 🔴 Blocking | Must be fixed before merge |
| HIGH | 🟠 Blocking | Must be fixed before merge |
| MEDIUM | 🟡 Non-blocking | Review recommended |
| LOW | 🔵 Non-blocking | Update when convenient |

---

## Overview

What dependency scanning checks: **known CVEs in your project's packages** — npm dependencies, lock files, and other supported ecosystems.

The dependency scanning workflow:
- ✅ Runs automatically on every PR to `main` and push to `main`
- ✅ Scans the project filesystem with Trivy
- ✅ Posts vulnerability report as PR comments
- ✅ Creates GitHub issues when CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities land on `main`
- ✅ Fails PRs with CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities

## Files Involved

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `Taskfile.yml` (`dependencies*` tasks) | Local task runner config |
| `.ss/scripts/generate-dependencies-md.py` | Report generator |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `.ss/reports/dependencies/` |

## Key Configuration Points

### Change the Blocking Threshold

To block only on CRITICAL (not HIGH), edit the `check-dependencies` step in `ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml`:

```bash
# Change this line:
if v.get('Severity', '').upper() in ('CRITICAL', 'HIGH'):
# To:
if v.get('Severity', '').upper() == 'CRITICAL':
```

### Disable Dependency Scanning

```bash
# Option A: delete the workflow
rm .github/workflows/ss-security-vulnerability-all-check.yml

# Option B: disable in GitHub UI → Actions → Dependency Vulnerability Scan → Disable workflow
```

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install Task (one-time)
curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Run dependency scan
task dependencies
```

Reports are saved to `.ss/reports/dependencies/`.

# Secrets Detection

This template includes automated secrets detection using **Gitleaks** to identify hardcoded credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data in your source code and git history. This guide explains how to customise and use this feature.

## Quick Start

### Run Analysis Locally
```bash
task secrets
```

### What You Get Automatically
- ✅ PR comments with secrets detection report
- ✅ Merge blocking if any secrets are detected
- ✅ GitHub issues on main branch if secrets land there

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow not triggering? | Check workflow is at `.github/workflows/ss-security-secrets-check.yml` |
| False positives? | Add a `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist (see below) |
| Don't want secrets checks? | Delete `.github/workflows/ss-security-secrets-check.yml` |

---

## Overview

What secrets detection checks: **hardcoded credentials** — API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, and other sensitive values in source code files and git history.

The secrets workflow:
- ✅ Runs automatically on every PR to `main` and push to `main`
- ✅ Scans all files and full git history with Gitleaks
- ✅ Posts findings as PR comments
- ✅ Creates GitHub issues when secrets land on `main`
- ✅ Fails PRs whenever secrets are detected (always blocking)

## Files Involved

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ss-security-secrets-check.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `Taskfile.yml` (`secrets*` tasks) | Local task runner config |
| `.ss/scripts/generate-secrets-md.py` | Report generator |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `.ss/reports/secrets/` |

## Suppressing False Positives

Create a `.gitleaks.toml` in the project root to allowlist known false positives:

```toml
[allowlist]
description = "Project allowlist"

# Allowlist a specific file
paths = [
  '''tests/fixtures/.*'''
]

# Allowlist a specific pattern (e.g. a test key)
regexes = [
  '''AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE'''
]

# Allowlist a specific commit
commits = [
  "abc123def456"
]
```

## If Secrets Are Detected

Act immediately:

1. **Revoke** the exposed credential (rotate API keys, invalidate tokens)
2. **Remove** the secret from the codebase
3. **Clean git history** if the secret was committed:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
   Or use [BFG Repo Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) for a simpler approach.
4. **Force-push** the cleaned history (coordinate with your team)

## Disable Secrets Checking

```bash
# Option A: delete the workflow
rm .github/workflows/ss-security-secrets-check.yml

# Option B: disable in GitHub UI → Actions → Secrets Detection → Disable workflow
```

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install Task (one-time)
curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Run secrets detection
task secrets
```

Reports are saved to `.ss/reports/secrets/`.
