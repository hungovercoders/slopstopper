# llms.txt AI-Discoverability Check

`ss:reliability:llms-txt`, implemented in [`cli/slopstopper/checks/llms_txt.py`](../../cli/slopstopper/checks/llms_txt.py), audits your site's `/llms.txt` as the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) convention defines it. `llms.txt` is a curated markdown map at the site root that lets AI assistants and agents read your key content directly, instead of parsing noisy HTML. It complements [`ss:reliability:seo`](SEO.md): SEO covers what human-facing crawlers read, this covers the surface an LLM reads.

The check is Python stdlib only, so it adds no dependencies on top of Python 3.

## What gets validated

The check fetches `/llms.txt` and asserts a **well-formed** file per the convention.

**Hard-fail (exit 1):**

- The file is reachable (HTTP 200)
- The body is non-empty
- The first content line is an H1 (`# <name>`)
- At least one markdown inline link is present

**Advisory (notes only, unless escalated via config):**

- Content-Type is `text/plain` or `text/markdown`
- A `> summary` blockquote follows the H1, as the spec recommends. Escalate with `require_summary`
- When `check_links` is on, every link is HEAD-verified as reachable (non-4xx/5xx)

Because `llms.txt` is an *unratified* convention, the hard-fail bar is deliberately low. The check confirms the file exists and is structurally valid without imposing contested opinions.

## Configuration

Read from environment variables or `.slopstopper.yml`'s `reliability.llms_txt` block:

| Variable / key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLMS_TXT_TEST_URL` | (none, required) | Base URL to audit |
| `LLMS_TXT_PATH` | `/llms.txt` | Path to the file |
| `reliability.llms_txt.check_links` | `false` | HEAD-verify every link inside llms.txt (`--check-links`) |
| `reliability.llms_txt.require_summary` | `false` | Fail if the `> summary` blockquote is missing (`--require-summary`) |

## Running it

```bash
# Audit a deployed site
task ss:reliability:llms-txt -- https://your-site.example.com

# Audit the local build and verify every link resolves
LLMS_TXT_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
task ss:reliability:llms-txt -- --check-links
```

Generated reports are written to:

- `.ss/reports/llms-txt/llms-txt-report.md` (human-readable)
- `.ss/reports/llms-txt/llms-txt-report.json` (machine-readable)

## Authoring an llms.txt

A minimal, valid file:

```markdown
# Your Project

> One-sentence summary of what this is.

## Docs
- [Getting started](https://example.com/start): how to install and run
- [Reference](https://example.com/reference): the full API

## Optional
- [Changelog](https://example.com/changelog): release history
```

This site's own file, [`app/llms.txt`](../../app/llms.txt), is the canonical example.

## Why this exists

A product whose value proposition is quality for the AI/agent era should be legible to agents. `llms.txt` gives an AI assistant evaluating your project a clean, curated entry point, so you control what it surfaces and how it's described rather than leaving it to scrape 60k of HTML. Adoption by major crawlers is still emerging, so the check verifies presence and structure cheaply rather than gating on a contested standard.

## CI integration

The [`ss-reliability-llms-txt-check.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ss-reliability-llms-txt-check.yml) workflow runs on every PR, every push to `main`, on `deployment_status` success, and daily. PR runs comment back with pass/fail and a link to the artefact.
