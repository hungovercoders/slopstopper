"""HTTP plumbing shared by every URL-driven check.

Eight checks carried their own copy of the SSRF guard, seven their own
`urlopen` wrapper, four their own HEAD probe, three their own URL
joiner. Four of the `_fetch` copies were byte-identical down to the
`nosec` comments. Eight guards is eight places to forget one; this is
the one.

The guard is the point. `urllib.request.urlopen` happily handles
`file://` and `ftp://`, so a hostile `*_TEST_URL` value such as
`file:///etc/passwd` would be read by a checker and, on some paths,
echoed into a report. Every request a check makes goes through
`open_url`, which refuses anything but http/https before opening it
(raising ValueError, since that is a bad input) and again on every
redirect: urllib follows a `302 Location: ftp://…` on its own, so a guard
on the first URL alone is not a guard. A refused redirect is an HTTPError.
That is a fact about the target, reported like any other status and never
an abort.

Checks keep a module-level `_fetch` / `_head_ok` name that delegates
here, so tests can monkeypatch the check they are testing without
reaching into this module. Every check uses `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.
