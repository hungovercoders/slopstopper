"""Secrets detection (Gitleaks wrapper).

Ports the bash security:secrets flow into one self-contained check:

  task secrets:check-tool   (installs gitleaks if missing)
  + gitleaks detect --source=. --redact --report-format=json --report-path=...
  + python3 .ss/scripts/generate-secrets-md.py

Subprocess-invokes `gitleaks` — the same licensing-boundary pattern as
complexity (lizard). Adopters install gitleaks themselves (MIT). The
slopstopper-cli wheel ships zero gitleaks code.

The JSON report never holds a credential on disk. Gitleaks' native output
carries the captured value verbatim (`Secret`), the source text around it
(`Match`, `Line`) and the commit message (`Message`), which can quote the
same value. Both reports are uploaded as CI artifacts, which anyone with
read access to the repo can download for the retention window — so a
check whose job is to contain a leak would otherwise widen its audience.
Two layers, so no window exists in which an unredacted file sits on disk:

  1. gitleaks runs with `--redact`, so `Secret` / `Match` are written as
     "REDACTED" by the scanner itself — nothing to clean up if the check
     is killed between the scan and the rewrite.
  2. `_read_findings` is the report's only read site: it strips the
     credential-bearing keys (plus `Author` / `Email`, PII with no use in
     a report) and rewrites the file before returning, so no caller in
     this module or any importer ever sees an unredacted finding.

A report that cannot be read or parsed is scrubbed and replaced by one
sentinel finding, and the check exits 1: gitleaks ran and wrote
something, which may have been a secret, so it is treated as one — a
tracking issue is opened rather than the run shrugged off. No report at
all means gitleaks never got as far as writing one (not a git repo, a bad
ref, killed): that is exit 2. The previous run's report is removed before
every scan, so it can never stand in for this one.

Exit codes:
  0 — no secrets detected
  1 — one or more secrets detected, or gitleaks' report could not be read
      (counted as a finding — see above). The check itself is the gate
  2 — gitleaks is not installed, arguments were passed (this check takes
      none), or gitleaks wrote no report — the scan did not run
