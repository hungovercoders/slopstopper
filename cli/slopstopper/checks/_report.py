"""Report scaffolding shared by every check.

Each check writes a markdown report that `slopstopper emit` turns into a
PR comment or an issue, and `comment.py` reads that markdown back with a
regex — `^\\s*-\\s*❌\\s*(.+?)$` — to list the failing items. That means the
PR bot's output silently depends on every check emitting the same bullet
syntax. Seventeen modules used to hand-roll it; this is where the
contract lives, so a new check gets it right by construction.

Also the one timestamp. Nine checks had `_generated_at` in three
different formats; a report should not depend on which module wrote it.
