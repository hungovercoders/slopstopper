"""What the four Playwright-backed checks share.

smoke, e2e, accessibility and broken-links each drive a bundled Playwright
spec against a URL and write a short pass/fail summary pointing at
Playwright's own HTML report. Only the spec name, the env vars the spec
reads and the wording differ, so the plumbing lives here once:
`run_check` is the whole flow, and each check module contributes a
`Check` description plus its `_build_env` (the config keys its spec reads).
That pair is a module's entire production surface.

The eject dance is the non-obvious part and is documented once, here:
the bundled config and specs live inside the installed slopstopper-cli
package (mise's tool install, per mise.toml), where Playwright
cannot resolve `node_modules`. Ejecting them into `.ss/` in the
adopter's CWD puts them next to `node_modules`. It is idempotent.

Exit codes (the contract every one of these checks keeps):
  0: playwright tests passed
  1: playwright tests ran and failed (report still written)
  2: npx (Node.js) not available, the URL is missing, the spec could
      not be found, or Playwright exited with any other non-zero code
      (the suite didn't run to a verdict). Playwright exiting 1 without
      running the tests (a config error, no tests found, the browser
      failing to launch) is 2 as well
