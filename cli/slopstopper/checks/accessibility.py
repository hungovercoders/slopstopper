"""Accessibility audit (Playwright + axe-core wrapper).

Ports the bash reliability:accessibility flow:

  task ss:reliability:accessibility -- https://your-site.example.com

  which is, under the covers:

  ACCESSIBILITY_PAGES=$(python3 .ss/scripts/discover-pages.py
                                accessibility --event=local)
  ACCESSIBILITY_TEST_URL=...
  npx playwright test --config=.ss/playwright.config.js
                      .ss/tests/accessibility.spec.ts
                      --reporter=list[,html]

Subprocess-invokes `npx playwright`. Playwright is Apache-2.0, axe-core
is MPL-2.0; the slopstopper-cli wheel ships zero code from either —
both bind in via the adopter's node_modules. Page discovery uses the
in-CLI slopstopper.discovery module.

Falls back to SMOKE_TEST_URL when ACCESSIBILITY_TEST_URL is unset,
matching the bash flow exactly.

Configuration (.slopstopper.yml — all optional):

    pages:
      accessibility: /,/blog,/about
    reliability:
      coverage:
        pr: changed     # see slopstopper.discovery for the resolution order
        main: sitemap

See .slopstopper.yml.example for the canonical schema and coverage
modes.

Exit codes:
  0 — playwright tests passed
  1 — playwright tests ran and failed (report still written)
  2 — npx (Node.js) not available, the URL is missing, the bundled
      spec could not be found, or Playwright exited with any other
      non-zero code (the suite didn't run to a verdict).
      Playwright exiting 1 without running the tests (a config error,
      no tests found, the browser failing to launch) is 2 as well
