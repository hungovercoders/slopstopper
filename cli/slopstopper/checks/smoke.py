"""Smoke tests against a live URL (Playwright wrapper).

Implements the reliability:smoke flow:

  slopstopper run reliability:smoke -- --url https://your-site.example.com

  which is, under the covers:

  SMOKE_TEST_URL=...
  SMOKE_OG_IMAGE_PATH=<smoke.og_image_path from .slopstopper.yml>
  SMOKE_PAGES=<pages.smoke from .slopstopper.yml>
  npx playwright test --config=<resolved playwright config>
                      <resolved smoke spec>
                      --reporter=list[,html]

Subprocess-invokes `npx playwright` — Playwright is Apache-2.0; the
slopstopper-cli wheel ships zero Playwright code. The test specs and
Playwright config are bundled in the wheel; adopters can override by
writing same-named files under .ss/ (see slopstopper.templates).

Configuration (.slopstopper.yml — all optional):

    pages:
      smoke: /,/blog,/about       # which paths to smoke-test
    smoke:
      og_image_path: /og-image.png  # '' to skip the og-image assertion

See .slopstopper.yml.example for the canonical schema.

Exit codes:
  0 — playwright tests passed
  1 — playwright tests ran and failed (report still written)
  2 — npx (Node.js) not available, the URL is missing, the bundled
      spec could not be found, or Playwright exited with any other
      non-zero code (the suite didn't run to a verdict).
      Playwright exiting 1 without running the tests (a config error,
      no tests found, the browser failing to launch) is 2 as well
