"""PR-comment bodies: compact per-check verdicts and the aggregate summary.

Reports are written as standalone documents — an H1, an overall verdict,
per-item sections, a folded evidence table, a "How to Fix" section. That
is the right shape for a file you open deliberately, and the wrong shape
for nineteen of them stacked on a pull request: on an all-passing run the
suite used to post ~390 lines of markdown across 19 comment cards, so the
one thing a reviewer wants — did anything fail — was the hardest thing to
find.

This module renders what actually goes in a comment:

  build_body()     one check → a verdict line, the failing items, and the
                   full report folded away. Driven by the check's exit
                   status, which the workflow passes in, not by parsing
                   the report for a verdict.
  build_summary()  every check → one table, from the workflow runs GitHub
                   already recorded for the head SHA. A green PR gets a
                   single three-line comment; a red one leads with the
                   failures.

Naming is not re-declared here. A check's display label comes from
`profiles.CHECK_WORKFLOWS` (check → workflow file) chained through
`badges.WORKFLOW_DISPLAY` (workflow file → human label), so the label on
a PR comment, on a README badge and in the summary table are the same
string from the same place.
