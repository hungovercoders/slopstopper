"""Guard: every check workflow appears in both `workflow_run` trigger lists.

Two workflows react to the others finishing, and GitHub does not support
globs in `workflow_run.workflows` — each name must be spelled out:

- `ss-pr-summary.yml` re-renders the single rolling PR comment. A
  workflow left out still runs and still posts its own comment, but the
  summary silently stops re-rendering after it, so the headline count
  goes stale without anything going red.
- `ss-workflow-failure-issue.yml` raises a tracking issue when a check
  fails on main. A workflow left out can fail on main and nobody hears —
  the product's "nothing fails silently" promise, broken in its own repo.
  When this test was added the list was eleven checks stale and named a
  workflow that no longer existed.

The requirement is documented in AGENTS.md and both skills; nothing
enforced it until this test, and adding checks is exactly when it bites.

Parsed with a small line reader rather than a YAML library: the CLI
ships no third-party dependencies and the test suite holds the same
line.
