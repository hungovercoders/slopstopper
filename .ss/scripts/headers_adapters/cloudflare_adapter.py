"""
Cloudflare _headers text format adapter.

Parses the native Cloudflare _headers file (also used by Netlify) into
the same {for, csp} shape as the JSON adapter. Format:

    /path-pattern
      Header-Name: value
      Another-Header: value

    /other-pattern
      ...

Path patterns are at column 0; header lines are indented; lines starting
with `#` are comments. A blank line followed by a new path at column 0
starts a new block.
